                        <p>A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2),
                            the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure
                            and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
                            This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine technologies during early 2020. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was
                            on preventing symptomatic,
                            often severe illness.</p>

                        <p>Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at
                            high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.
                            Single dose interim use is under consideration to extend vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability improves.</p>
